## C# and .NET Course
------------------------------------------------------
This is part of my course work for The Tech Academy's Software Developer
program.  This course starts with the Fundamentals of C# and Microsoft's .NET Framework and builds up to intermediate concepts. The course consists of hands on assignments, challenges, and projects.  Below are a few of the selected projects.

## Projects
--------------------------------------------------------
These are basic projects written in C# and use various features of .NET Framework and Core

* BlackJack Game
* Car Insurance
* Online Newsletter Form

### BlackJack Game
This is a fully functioning console application game. The game is divided into a Library called Casino and the program file called Twenty_one_game. Making this game allowed me to use all of necessary C# fundamentals that are required as a well versed C# developer.

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC application that mimics a car insurance website.  It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic.  There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### Online Newsletter Form
This project is an MVC web Application that mimics a newsletter subscription form. This project uses Entity Framework to add and remove subscribers from the mailing list. The model used here is "Database-first" model approach.
